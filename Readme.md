# Arduino and web monitoring project
This is just a small-scale project to monitor the temperature and humidity changes in my home.
I've been using a humidity and temperature sensor on my Arduino board connected to my Raspberry Pi, which hosts the node.js server and database storing values
This is the server-side of the project

# Web interface
You can access the data locally via a really simple web interface and it plots the data collected between selected periods

built by using the MERN stack
